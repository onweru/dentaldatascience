A Case-control study compares patients who have a disease or outcome of interest (cases) with patients who do not have the disease or outcome (controls), and looks back retrospectively to compare how frequently the exposure to a risk factor is present in each group to determine the relationship between the risk factor and the disease.

Case control studies are observational because no intervention is attempted and no attempt is made to alter the course of the disease. The goal is to retrospectively determine the exposure to the risk factor of interest from each of the two groups of individuals: cases and controls. These studies are designed to estimate odds.

Case control studies are also known as "retrospective studies" and "case-referent studies."

In the classic textbook of Breslow and Day about [data analysis of cancer research](http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/stat/sp32/index.php),this is the table of the study about risk factors for oesophageal cancer: 

![From Breslow and N. E. Day, ch 4.](/img/grouped-data-case-control.png)

We will use dplyr and ggplot2 to graph this data.
In this project, we will recreate this table the `tidyverse` way.

First, we load the meta-package __tidyverse__ thant contains packages as __dplyr__ for data wrangling among others.

```{r tidyverse, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The dataset of the book can be found here

```{r dataset}
df <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/data_esoph", col_names = FALSE)
```

Let's see the first six rows of the dataset
```{r head 1}
head(df)
```
Data is without column names. The variables are: 


| COL   | VAR       | RANGE/VALUES                     |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| 1     | Age group | 1 = 25-34                        |
|       | (years)   | 2 = 35-44                        |
|       |           | 3 = 45-54                        |
|       |           | 4 = 55-64                        |
|       |           | 5 = 65-74                        |
|       |           | 6 = 75+                          |
| 2     | Alcohol   | 1 =  0-39                        |
|       | (gms/day) | 2 = 40-79                        |
|       |           | 3 = 80-119                       |
|       |           | 4 = 120+                         |
| 3     | Tobacco   | 1 =  0- 9                        |
|       | (gms/day) | 2 = 10-19                        |
|       |           | 3 = 20-29                        |
|       |           | 4 = 30+                          |
| 4     | Case  or  | 1 = case                         |
|       | Control   | 0 = control                      |

Now, we will ad the column names: 

```{r add colnames}
colnames(df) <- (c("age", "alc", "tob", "cc"))
```

Check: 
```{r head 2}
head(df)
```

Since we know the codes, we will recode all the dataset using the function `mutate` and `case_when` of `dplyr`

Age groups
1 = 25-34
2 = 35-44
3 = 45-54
4 = 55-64
5 = 65-74
6 = 75+

```{r mutate age}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    age_grp = 
      case_when(
        age == 1 ~ "25-34", 
        age == 2 ~ "35-44", 
        age == 3 ~ "45-54", 
        age == 4 ~ "55-64", 
        age == 5 ~ "65-74", 
        TRUE ~ "75+", 
      )
  )
```

```{r check head}
head(df)
```
 OK!
 
 The same for the rest of the variables
__Alcohol__
 
```{r mutate alc}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    alc_grp = 
      case_when(
        alc == 1 ~  "0-39", 
        alc == 2 ~ "40-79",  
        alc == 3 ~ "80-119",  
        TRUE ~ "120+" 
      )
  )
```
 
__Tobacco__

```{r mutate tob}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    tob_grp = 
      case_when(
        tob == 1 ~  "0- 9", 
        tob == 2 ~ "10-19", 
        tob == 3 ~ "20-29", 
        TRUE ~ "30+" 
      )
  )
```

__Group__
```{r mutate cc}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(
    cc_grp = 
      case_when(
        cc == 0 ~ "control", 
        TRUE ~ "case"
      )
  )
```

Now, omit the former columns

```{r unselect}
df <- df %>% 
  select(age_grp:cc_grp)
```

and now, we have to give the order of the factors for the ordinal variables age, alcohol and tobbaco


```{r factor age, results='hide'}
df %>% 
  mutate(age_grp = factor(age_grp, levels = c("25-34",
                                              "35-44"	,
                                              "45-54"	,
                                              "55-64"	,
                                              "65-74"	,
                                              "75"
)))
```

```{r factor alc, results='hide'}
df %>% 
  mutate(alc_grp = factor(alc_grp, levels = c("0-39",
                                              "40-79",
                                              "80-119",
                                              "120"
)))
```


```{r factor tob, results='hide'}
df %>% 
  mutate(tob_grp = factor(tob_grp, levels = c("0- 9",
                                              "10-19",
                                              "20-29",
                                              "30+"
                                              )))
```

Now we have the data ready for the analysis!

Let's make the table 1
We have two options, first the traditional table: 

```{r table 1}
table(df$age_grp, df$cc_grp)
```

Here we can add the margins with

```{r margins}
addmargins(table(df$age_grp, df$cc_grp))
```
or make a proportional table, with
```{r prop}
options(digits = 2) # limit the digits to two decimals
prop.table(table(df$age_grp, df$cc_grp))*100
```

The same table in the dplyr way: 

```{r table tidy}
df %>% 
  group_by(age_grp, cc_grp) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  spread(cc_grp, n)
```

 or as proportional table: 
 
```{r table dplyr prop}
df %>%
  count(age_grp, cc_grp) %>%
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n)*100) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(cc_grp, prop)
```


For alcohol: 

```{r table alcohol dplyr}
df %>% 
  group_by(alc_grp, cc_grp) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  spread(cc_grp, n)
```

and tobacco:

```{r table tob dplyr}
df %>% 
  group_by(tob_grp, cc_grp) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  spread(cc_grp, n)
```
