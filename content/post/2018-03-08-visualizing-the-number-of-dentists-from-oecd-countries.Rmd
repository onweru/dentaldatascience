The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development host a [database](https://data.oecd.org/) with extensive data. In this post we will some visualizations to compare the number of dentists in each country. 

Packages used: 

  - tidyverse
  - gghighlight
  - kableExtra

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


First we load the data. Now there is a package ([OECD](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OECD/index.html)) able to extract the datasets, but I will use a local copy: 

```{r}
dent_oecd <- read_csv("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vStv7Pr69DtRKv6Nw6gVBep8hbT3pEeO6B1vNwxK_1DUHgpoTgbuRpZ4SvgtHFQnBZJVGeeQVyRuXZl/pub?gid=1330297229&single=true&output=csv")
```
Always is preferable to take a look the data and its structure: 

```{r}
head(dent_oecd)
```
```{r}
glimpse(dent_oecd)
```

And a summary: 

```{r}
summary(dent_oecd)
```


I will use the `Dentists graduates`, and `Per 100 000 population` so let's filter and replace the former data set

```{r}
dent_oecd <- dent_oecd %>% 
  filter(Variable == "Dentists graduates", 
         Measure == "Per 100 000 population")
```

Let's plot. Since is a temporal trend, a line plot could be a good idea: 
```{r}
dent_oecd %>%  # this means: take the dent_oecd dataframe, and
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Country)) + #plot the year in the X axis, the value in the y axis and color the lines per country
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y = "Dentists graduation per 100 000 hab")
```

Hmmm....the problem here is that isn't easy to differentiate the countries. 

We have to choices: 
  - plot each country separate, or
  - highlight one or few countries from the group we can use the package
  
## Plotting one graph per country: faceting.
```{r}
dent_oecd  %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value)) + # we delete the color = Country, since is not necessary
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~Country) + #this means: plot separately each country 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour="grey20",size=6)) + 
  labs(y = "Dentists graduation per 100 000 hab")
  
```

That's much better. Some observations 

  - seem in general dentist graduating per 100 000 habitants has been stable in OECD countries, 
  - Chile seems to be increasing at a higher rate his graduation rate. Also Lithuania seems to share this trend.
   - The line in Portugal is higher than in the rest of the countries
   - Few countries decrease their graduation rate, seems that Denmark, Finland and Norway share this trend


_TODO: learn how to order the plots, e.g. from higher rate to lower _

We can transform the Value var using the log10. With `ggplot2` we can directly add the transformation to any axis, as y-axis in this case. We use `scale_y_log10()`. Sometimes is worth to use to expand some small differences or to graph data with orders of magnitude of difference. 

```{r}
dent_oecd  %>% 
  filter(Year < 2016) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~Country) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=6)) + 
  labs(y = "log10 Dentists graduation per 100 000 hab") + 
  scale_y_log10()
  
```

## Using `gghighlight`
`gghighlight` is a package that highlight ggplot's Lines and Points with Predicates

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(gghighlight)
```

Remember the first graph: 

```{r}
dent_oecd %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Country)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(y = "Dentists graduation per 100 000 hab")
```

With gghighlight we can, as the name implies, highlight some lines according to a criteria or predicate. 

```{r}
dent_oecd %>% 
  filter(Year < 2016) %>% 
  gghighlight_line(aes(x = Year, y = Value, color = Country), 
                   predicate = mean(Value) > 5) + # this is the threshold
  labs(y = "Dentists graduation per 100 000 hab") 
```

And a pivot table in the `dplyr` way
```{r}
dent_oecd %>% 
  group_by(Country, Year) %>% 
  summarise(average = mean(Value)) %>% 
  spread(Year, average)
```

Now enhance the table with the package `kableExtra`: 

`install.packages("kableExtra")`

`library(kableExtra)`

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(kableExtra)
```
First I create the table and store as an object called `table_dent`
```{r}
table_dent <- dent_oecd %>% 
  group_by(Country, Year) %>% 
  summarise(average = mean(Value)) %>% 
  spread(Year, average) 
```

then apply the `kable` enhance to the object `table_dent` to show a nice formatted table: 

```{r, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(table_dent, 
             caption = "Dentists graduating per 100 000 habs. OECD countries")
```
