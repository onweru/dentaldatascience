# Purpose of this site
This site is dedicated to discuss issues about data generated by dental research, and tools to explore those data, extract information and generate knowledge in a valid and reproducible way. 

Main topics are

  - Analyses of datasets with data from dental research or oral public health
  - Comments on dental papers with innovative or creative exploratory data analysis

Unless a good reason, every post will have at least one reproducible example.

> Perhaps the biggest barrier to reproducible research is the lack of a deeply ingrained culture that simply requires reproducibility for all scientific
claims. Not unlike the culture of replication that persists across all scientific disciplines, the scientific community needs to develop a "culture of reproducibility" for computational science and require it of published claims. [R Peng, 2011](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226.full) 

## Tools used in this site
This site discuss exploratory data analysis with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) package. This site was created using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

# About the author

[Sergio Uribe](http://www.sergiouri.be/). I am Associate Professor at the [School of Dentistry, Universidad Austral de Chile](http://www.medicina.uach.cl/escuelas/odontologia/index.php). In the 90s I use Epi Info (6.04 of course), SPSS during 2000-2008 (which I regret) and in 2008 I discovered R. But the real incentive to use R was recently since 

 - the development of the tidyverse, a set of tools that allow a human readable workflow for data analysis, and
 - the development of rmarkdown, to create dinamic documents that allow the easy deployment of reproducible code integrated to documents.

On this site I will share my learning journey.I took this decision after listening to [David Robinson podcast](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/citizen-data-science).
